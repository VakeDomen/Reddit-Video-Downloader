# Reddit-Video-Downloader
GIFs and Images are easy to save from Reddit, videos on the other hand. This script downloads the video and provides you with the URL for the video. 
In this script I tried practising user input protection (No matter what you type in, the script should never crash) so if you manage to crash it, please tell me how :)

For the sound to download, you need to have [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed and added to your PATH, for windows users use [this link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/94933-how-do-i-edit-my-system-path-in-windows#:~:text=In%20Windows%2C%20environment,MATLAB%20R2016b%2C%20add%3A)

*The artifacts are caused by my Video to GIF software, the script will not introduce artifacts to the video*
